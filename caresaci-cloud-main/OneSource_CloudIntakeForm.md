### Description


> **Guidance**: A well thought-out description of your application will help us to better understand the use, architecture, and infrastructure you plan on deploying.  Use this section to describe your application, its use case(s), and why you want to house it in the public cloud as opposed to any other platform. Where possible please include the Business Platform, Business Product, Capability or Utility information.
----------------------------------------

The OneSource database application is a UI for database that houses non-PHI member information such as Address, Phone, and Email.

The goal of the project OneSource Database is to maintain, update and track the changes in the member's contact information so that the authorized users have a central place where they can get this information to reach out to the members.

OneSource Database maintains the member details like GMPI id, date of birth, Phone number, email address and address details etc at one place. The portal enables the users to lookup details for any member using GMPI id, first name, last name and so on. 

Users can modify the member's contact information through the portal, mark any contact information as invalid if they were not able to reach the member using the information and update the overall outreach status for the member.






----------------------------------------

#
### Business Segment Chief Architect Awareness

> **Guidance**: Use this section to provide the proof of approval from the Business Segment Chief Architect (or listed delegate) - if required by your Line of Business.
> * Embed a screenshot image of an email from your Business Segment Architect which provides dated confirmation of their review and approval of this Public Cloud request.
> * Please ensure that the approval is dated within 30 days of your submission, and that the date of the eMail is visible.
> * Note:  Separate approvals are needed for each environment [nonProd / Prod] and should be noted in the Chief Architect approval statement.

### User Details

> **Guidance**: Understanding the users of your Application will help us to guide you in the best approach to securing your infrastructure.  Providing this information will allow the Intake team to guide you on your Architecture, Network and Security reviews.  Use this section to describe your application's users.
> Some things to think about (non-exhaustive):
> - Who are your users?
> - Are they internal (UHG Employees), external, or a mix of both?
> - Please indicate the Identity domains (Onprem MS, AzureAD, HSID, OneHealthcare ID, etc) used to authenticate the internal/external users
> - Describe how you are authenticating and authorizing users
--------------------
>- WellMed users ~ 700 users
>- WellMed internal only
>- OneHealthcare ID
>- Users are authenticated via OneHealthcare ID identity provider. The access token obtained from OneHealthcare ID will be used to authenticate users to OneSource application.
	The users must be marked active in the OneSource Database in order to login successfully .
	Once the users are logged in, there is no roles based authorization as the same is not required as confirmed from the business as well i.e. all authenticated users should have read/write privileges once they have successfully logged in.






----------------------------------------

### Workload Placement use case

> **Guidance**: While public cloud is often an excellent choice, not all workloads are a good fit for public cloud. Our team can help validate the public cloud is the right placement option for your solution.Â  Please describe how your use case meets one (or more) of the criteria found in the [Helpful Links](https://cloud.optum.com/docs/intake/intake-links) .  Addressing more than one use case is advantageous.  
----------------------------------------
- [ ] I would like to engage with the Vanguard team to determine if Public Cloud is the best choice for our Application.

>-  Volatile or Elastic Capacity
>- Isolated workload -

## Section 3: Code Delivery and Management
Code delivery and management is the responsibility of application team. However, commercial cloud governance is predicated on infrastructure as code and platforms that accelerate adoption as the enterprise compliant path. It is required that all cloud applications fully implement IaC and automated CI/CD pipelines. Applications that do not will be flagged as out of compliance on Cloud Board.

> - **Overall Guidance**
>   - **NOTE:** verify that the members of the MS/hcc_intake SECURE group have access to these repos
>   - _**BETTER YET**_ - **make your repo Public** and share your expertise with the Optum community!

### Infrastructure as Code
> **Guidance:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows you to build your infrastructure in an automated fashion.  This reduces your ongoing Operations Costs, and provides a simple, repeatable and secure way to build your Cloud Infrastructure, as well as supporting Disaster Recovery Operations.
> 
> - **ARM Templates are not an appropriate way to manage Infrastructure as Code as it does not manage state, or provide measurement of status which is a part of the HCC strategy.**
> 
> - **NonProd requests:**  Please identify the IaC method (most often Terraform) that will be leveraged
> - **Prod requests:** provide the actual links to the IaC/Terraform code that builds the cloud components.
----------------------------------------
- [ ] My team would like to engage with the Vanguard team to discuss the use of Infrastructure as Code and best practices

My team will be using Terraform to build our Infrastructure as Code

[For **Production** accounts, use this space to provide the direct links to your IaC GitHub repos]


----------------------------------------

### CI/CD

> **Guidance**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are signs of a mature Engineering Practice.  CI/CD ensures that you are deploying the most up to date, validated code into your environment, as well as automatically generating your testing environment to have a better test cycle, and employ automated testing.  Jenkins is the preferred CI/CD tool at Optum.
>
> **NonProd requests:** Please identify the CI/CD service you are planning to use
>
> **Prod requests:** provide the actual links to successful fully automated builds of your IaC in a CI/CD pipeline
> * this is often a link or links into your Jenkins instance(s)
> * **NOTE:** verify that the members of the MS/hcc_intake SECURE group have access to see the results
----------------------------------------
- [ ] My team would like to engage with the Vanguard team to discuss the use of CI/CD best practices

My team will be using Optum server version of the Azure DevOps (https://azuredevops.optum.com/) pipelines for our CI/CD process.

[For **Production** accounts, use this space to provide direct links to describe your CI/CD build pipelines.]
